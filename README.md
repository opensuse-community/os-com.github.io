# Welcome at openSUSE-Community!

This GitHub repository provides the source for the [openSUSE community website](https://www.opensuse-community.org) which provides public-facing documentation and  one-click installers for multimedia codecs and more.

It is a combination of Markdown, HTML, CSS which is rendered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

The [page](https://www.opensuse-community.org/) and it's content is provided by members of the openSUSE community. While we welcome the openness and open source base of our [favorite distribution](https://www.opensuse.org/), we also want to make the lives of our community easy and smooth: therefor, we provide a simple way to install the needed software which can not be provided directly by openSUSE.
