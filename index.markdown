# Welcome at openSUSE-Community

This page and the content here is provided by members of the [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) community.

While we welcome the openness and open source base of our favorite distribution, we also want to make the lives of our
community easy and smooth: therefor, we provide a simple way to install the needed software which can not be provided
directly by openSUSE.

## One-Click-Installers for openSUSE

Multimedia Codecs including MP3, DVD, DivX, MP4, x265, x264, WMV, WMA, MOV and
more via One click to install [patented / restricted / proprietary
software](https://en.opensuse.org/Restricted_formats) on openSUSE.

**NOTE:** These One-Click Installers currently only work with the **Firefox web
browser**.

### Multimedia Codecs like MP3, DVD, DivX, MP4

This will install patented software needed by the default multimedia players.
In the process it will add the Packman repository, allowing you to easily
install even more multimedia software such as VLC, MPlayer or ffmpeg.

When these warnings [in KDE](assets/img/kde-vendor-change.png) or [in
GNOME](assets/img/gnome-vendor-change.png) appear, choose the red marked
options and confirm (i.e. allow vendor change for the packages).
