                <description>Packman build software packages to enable users to easily install and remove software on Linux. More specifically, they do so for software that is not shipped as part of distributions or that are shipped as an outdated version. This "essential" subset of the Packman Repository only includes multimedia codecs, and therefore reduces the risk of package conflicts but also reduces the packages available. </description>
